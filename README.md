# Data-Analysis-with-Python-for-a-Universal-Bank-s-Personal-Loan-Modelling

Project Description:

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of Universal Bank’s dataset to uncover key insights into customer characteristics and spending habits. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and trends among higher-income individuals, particularly in relation to their credit card spending and the prevalence of online payment usage. By leveraging Python’s powerful data analysis libraries, we will:

Analyze customer demographics and spending behavior.

Segregate higher-income customers based on their credit card spending.

Examine the number of users utilizing online payment methods.

The findings from this analysis will provide valuable insights for the bank to tailor their services and marketing strategies effectively.
